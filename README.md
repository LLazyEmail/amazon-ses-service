An app for sending millions of emails as cheaply as possible. Mail for Good uses AWS Simple Email Service to send bulk emails at $0.10 per 1000 emails.

Mail for Good is fast and memory efficient, currently sending over 100 emails per second on a 1gb Digital Ocean VPS.

We've used Mail for Good to deliver newsletters to hundreds of thousands of campers per week.

In [setting_up.md](./docs/setting_up.md) you'll find how to connect, create your admin account and set up your AWS credentials allowing you to send your first blast.

## What does Mail for Good do?

With Mail for Good you can:

- Send email campaigns of unlimited size.
- Import emails saved in CSV format.
- Create templates to reuse for convenience when sending email campaigns.
- Track bounce rate and other standard metrics. You can also insert tracking pixels and unsubscribe links at the click of a button.
- Add custom fields to imported email lists such as names or cities.
- Grant other users (limited or otherwise) permissions to use your account on your behalf.
- Add embedded HTML newsletter sign up forms to your site. These are snippets of code that will let your users sign up with you at the click of a button.

### Performance

We're currently sending weekly email blasts of over 800,000 emails in 4 hours on a $10 per month Digital Ocean VPS with 1 GB memory and 1 core processor.

Mail for Good is fast and scales to the rate limit enforced by AWS.

### Why are we doing this?

We want to help nonprofits manage their email campaigns as inexpensively as possible, and have full control over their data.
